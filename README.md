# Golf

This is a multiplayer browser game written in React. It was a learning exercise in dealing with complex state in react. The abstraction of state mutation into utility files makes this an easy project to open up to a backend.

It's definitely an experiment and a WIP.

It's also got a long way to go with styling and adding animations.

## Setup

Run `npm install` and then `npm start`. You should see it come up automatically or by visiting `localhost:3000`.

Enjoy!
