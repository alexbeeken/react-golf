# Golf

This is a multiplayer browser game written in React. It was a learning exercise in dealing with complex state in react. The abstraction of state mutation into utility files makes this an easy project to open up to a backend.

It's definitely an experiment and a WIP.

It's also got a long way to go with styling and adding animations.

## Setup

Run `npm install` and then `npm start`. You should see it come up automatically or by visiting `localhost:3000`.

Enjoy!

## Customizing

The current app supports tracking scores for one game only.

The default is just one round but you can change that to 9 or 18 or whatever you like by changing the numRounds inside of App.js's options object inside the constructor. You can also adjust the numPlayers to another integer too.
